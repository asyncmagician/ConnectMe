# ConnectMe

ConnectMe is a 100% open-source project that combines a backend API developed in Express.js and a user interface developed in Vue 3. 
It is a social network designed exclusively for developers, providing a platform to connect, share knowledge, and collaborate.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

1. `api/`: This directory contains the backend of the application, developed using Express.js. It includes API routes, controllers, data models, and services required for the application's functionality.

2. `src/`: This directory contains the UI of the application, developed using Vue.js 3. It includes components, views, and other UI-related files for creating an interactive and engaging user experience.
